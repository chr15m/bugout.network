Hello, I'm Chris. I'm researching & implementing **decentralized technologies**.

Here you can find [software & hardware](#technology) I'm working on, and [posts I've written](#posts) on the topic. I'm interested in technology that enables users to control their own data, freedom of expression, web based decentralization, and trust minimised architectures.
